MyHuffmanCompressor - A Simple File Compression & Decompression Tool

This project implements Huffman Encoding for efficient file compression and decompression. It reads a text file, builds a frequency-based Huffman Tree, compresses the file into a smaller encoded format, and allows decompression to restore the original text.
🔹 Features:

✅ Compress any text file into a smaller binary-encoded format
✅ Decompress the encoded file back to its original content
✅ Uses Huffman Coding for optimal data compression
✅ Efficient Priority Queue implementation for tree construction
✅ User-friendly CLI for easy file selection
🔹 How It Works:

1️⃣ The program analyzes character frequency in a file
2️⃣ A Huffman Tree is built to generate unique binary codes
3️⃣ The text is converted into a compressed binary string
4️⃣ The encoded data and frequency table are stored in the output file
5️⃣ The decompression function restores the original file using the Huffman tree
🔹 Usage:

💻 Run the program, choose:
1️⃣ Compression Mode → Provide an input file and save a compressed file
2️⃣ Decompression Mode → Restore the original file from the compressed version
🔹 Tech Stack:

✔ Java (Core Logic & File Handling)
✔ Data Structures (Priority Queue, HashMap)
🔹 Future Enhancements:

🔹 Implement binary file compression for more efficiency
🔹 Add GUI support for an interactive user experience
🔹 Support for multiple file formats (not just text files)

📌 A great beginner-friendly project to understand Data Compression, Huffman Trees, and Priority Queues!
